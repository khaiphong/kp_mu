Technically, graph is a specific data structure used to model problems where a set of objects related to each other in some way. Most of the problems solved with graphs related to finding (1) best appropriate relationships and building organizations, (2) feed forward and backward for [ Right evolution toward What Count ], (3) the shortest or longest path from A to B and What features to explore from the path. Two of the most used types of representations are (a) "adjacent matrix" with size NxM where N is a number of vertices - which can be <b><a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/ai/blob/main/src/persona.rs" target="_blank">struts of real and complex values</a></b> using <a href="https://docs.rs/num/latest/num/complex/struct.Complex.html" target="_blank">Rust Complex data</a> - and (b) "adjacent list". This KpPlatform graph pioneers solutions in (1) and (2) using scientifically cultivable normative intelligence <b>#Prajna</b> to dynamically change the persona and environment toward <b>What Count</b> on top of current used technologies of graph analytics in (3). It can be done via reversed engineering of proven epistemic objectives actually known by living students such as KhaiPhong <b>#FourFoldTruth</b> - a fact-based epistemic objective - of Gotama's Dukkha, Jesus's <b>#GodKingdom</b> within, Zen's <b>#TamingTheOx</b>, KhaiPhong's <b>#PrajnaTIPs</b>, the East <b>#HeavenEarthPeople</b>, etc. <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/ai/blob/main/src/main.rs" target="_blank">Custom ai agents</a> are processes of Activation functions starting from open-and-closed-source LLM models and their combinations found Best for the cultivable neural network <a href="https://byteblog.medium.com/building-a-simple-neural-network-from-scratch-in-rust-3a7b12ed30a9" target="_blank">capable of learning the <b>XOR functions toward the Truth of epistemic objectives</b></a>, then <b>further trained with collected data from Inner Cloud and Outer Cloud</b> in the persona private "<b>Vault</b>" to start the persona's <b>Akashic records (Buddhist Alaya Vijnana / A-Lại-Da-Thức)</b> in one's possible Realm-after-Realm Continuity of the consciousness.

Starting from well-designed collected data, we generate a sequence of [ Guards / Sensors ] from deductive queries to a set of rapidly changing facts in Activities and Relationships at all Places. Via "<b>rule-based sensors / guards</b>", RAP (<b>Robotic Agent Programming</b>) executed in parallel can grap solid opportunities well suited to human/robot and/or robot/robot co-operative strategic tasks. It is an excellent opportunity to combine modern technologies and human strategic Think-on-Demand such as "<a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/990091640036715580/pdf/How-Will-Viet-Nam-Blossom-Reforming-Institutions-for-Effective-Implementation-Systematic-Country-Diagnostic-Update-2021.pdf" target="_blank">World Bank Diagnostic Update 2022-05-18</a>" at the Vietnamese "Vision (Tầm Nhìn)", engineering required "Resources (Năng Lực)", "Motivation (Động Lưc) to optimally control significant factors for reaching the target.
